# codonHomologizer.pl

## WHAT IS THIS:

This script, given a set of amino acid sequences and a codon usage table, constructs the underlying genetic sequences to optimize them for crossover events.  It takes 2 or more protein sequences, aligns them to optimize codon homology (using a custom amino acid weight matrix as input to a multiple sequence alignment tool (muscle)), and then recodes the amino acid sequences to be more homologous at the DNA level.  It utilizes the supplied codon usage table to prefer codons that are more common in a particular organism.

## DETAILS:

Note, the alignment step is a multiple sequence alignment, but the sequence construction step is pair-wise.  Each sequence is produced multiple times, optimized for crossover for every other sequence.

To omit codons from incorporation in the resulting sequence, omit them from the codon usage file (or comment them out - refer to the format for the -c file below).

This script produces "Crossover Metrics" intended to be used to evaluate how good each pair of sequences is in terms of their potential to be involved in crossover events.  Here is a listing of the columns in the Crossover Metrics table:

    Source             - The file the metrics are based on.
    Pair               - Sequential/arbitrary unique pair ID.
    Aln Len            - The length of the alignment produced.
    Seqs               - Sequence IDs.
    %ID                - % identity: identicals/non-gap-length.
    %Aligned NTs       - Non-gap aln length / aln length.
    Contig Ident >= N  - Sum of contiguous identical NTs >= N.
    Rare Cdns(Usg<=N)  - Number of codons incorporated whose usage is <= N.
    Rarest Codon       - Codon:usage.  Rarest codon incorporated.
    Frame Shift bases  - Number of NTs aligned out of frame.
    Seg Aln Score[0-1] - Segment alignment score, a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

The Seg Aln Score is only present if the -d option is used to align for example, similar protein structural domains with one another.  It can also be used to force stretches of identity to align in pairs of sequences by supplying it a file generated by stretchAlign.pl (provided with this package)

To evaluate a sequence (nt alignment) produced by another tool, you can use the -e option.  All this does is add entries to the Crossover Metrics table at the end of the run.

## INSTALL

Requires the multiple sequence alignment tool called muscle, available here:

     --extended           OPTIONAL Print extended usage.

## ADVANCED USAGE

    codonHomologizer.pl -c "input file(s)" [-i,-f,-o,-a,-s,--aa-aln-suffix,-x,-y,-z,-r,-w,-e,--stretch-reporting-min,--usage-reporting-max,-d,-n,--dir,--outfile,--help,--dry-run]
    codonHomologizer.pl -c "input file(s)" [-i,-f,-o,-a,-s,--aa-aln-suffix,-x,-y,-z,-r,-w,-e,--stretch-reporting-min,--usage-reporting-max,-d,-n,--dir,--outfile,--help,--dry-run] < input_file

     -c,--codon-file,     REQUIRED Tab-delimited file containing the single
     --codon-usage-file            letter amino acid (AA) code, codon, and
                                   [optional] usage score (see -n).  This
                                   script will only use the codons in this file
                                   to construct sequences and for the matrix
                                   used in the alignment step.  All AAs must be
                                   present.  If usage is unimportant, make the
                                   usage scores all the same (e.g. 1.0) or
                                   supply -n to ignore the usage column.
                                   Commented out lines in the file will be
                                   ignored.  See --help for more details.
     -i,--aa-file,*       OPTIONAL [stdin if present] Input file(s).  Space
                                   separated, globs OK (e.g. $flag "*.input
                                   [A-Z].{?,??}.inp").  See --help for file
                                   format.  May be supplied on standard in.
                                   When standard input detected and -i is given
                                   only 1 argument, it will be used as a file
                                   name stub for appending outfile suffixes.
                                   See --extended --help for advanced usage
                                   examples.
                                   *No flag required.
     -f,--aa-seq-format   OPTIONAL [auto]{auto, fasta, fastq} Amino acid
                                   sequence file format.  Applies to files
                                   submitted using -i and -e.
     -o,--dna-suffix,     OPTIONAL [.fna] The extension of the output DNA
     --dna-extension               sequence file that is constructed from and
                                   appended to the input amino acid sequence
                                   file (see -i).
     -a,--align-codons    OPTIONAL [1] Align the codons in the output DNA
                                   sequence file to match the amino acid
                                   alignment (see -o).  This is the default
                                   behavior.  Use --no-align-codons to generate
                                   sequences without gap characters.
     -s,--matrix-suffix,  OPTIONAL [none] The extension of the output protein
     --matrix-extension            weight matrix file that is appended to and
                                   constructed from the codon usage file (see
                                   -c).  The generation of this file is not
                                   required except for re-use and
                                   reproducability.  It can be re-used by
                                   supplying it using the -w option.
     --aa-aln-suffix      OPTIONAL [none] The aligned amino acid sequence
                                   generated by the alignment tool (-x/-y) can
                                   be optionally saved to a file.  While this
                                   file is not necessary, it can be useful for
                                   debugging.  The end goal is a DNA sequence.
                                   Note, the default outfile suffix for the DNA
                                   output is '.fna'.  If you want to output the
                                   amino acid alignment, it is recommended to
                                   use '.faa' to differentiate it from the DNA
                                   output file.
     -x,--alignment-tool  OPTIONAL [muscle]{muscle, clustalw} The system
                                   command line tool to be used in a system
                                   call to align the amino acid sequences (see
                                   -i).  The path to the executable can be
                                   provided by -y and the command line options
                                   can be tweaked using -z.
     -y,                  OPTIONAL [auto] The path to the executable selected
     --alignment-exe-path          by -x.  The default is simply the name of
                                   the executable selected by -x (e.g. 'muscle'
                                   or 'clustalw'), assuming it's in your PATH.
     -z,                  OPTIONAL [auto] Command line options provided to the
     --alignment-opts-str          sequence alignment tool specified by -y.
                                   The default is determined by the selection
                                   made with the -x option.  For muscle, the
                                   default options are [-gapopen -12 -gapextend
                                   -3].  For clustalw, the default options are
                                   [-pwgapopen -12 -pwgapext -3 -quiet].  Each
                                   command has a series of prohibited options
                                   that are controlled by the script.

                                   Muscle prohibited options: [-in -out -clw
                                   -fasta -html -phys -pyi -msf -clwstrict
                                   -clwout -clwstrictout -msfout -htmlout
                                   -physout -phyiout -matrix]

                                   Clustalw prohibited options: [-infile
                                   -pwmatrix -matrix -output -outfile -type
                                   -interactive]

                                   It is possible that other options other than
                                   these that are prohibited could cause
                                   problems, but the lists here represent only
                                   those specific options added by this script
                                   or those that directly conflict with those
                                   added by this script.
     -r,                  OPTIONAL [0] Treat the input AA sequence file as
     --precomputed-aa-             pre-aligned.  If you already have an amino
     alignment                     acid alignment and want to simply generate
                                   nucleotide sequences from them that have as
                                   much homology as possible, supply your AA
                                   alignment file using -i and supply this
                                   option to prevent the script from stripping
                                   the alignment characters (e.g. gaps '-') and
                                   re-aligning them.
     -w,                  OPTIONAL If you do not want this script to construct
     --precomputed-                a matrix based on homology and codon usage
     weight-matrix                 (using -c) to be used in aligning the amino
                                   acid sequences, supply your preferred matrix
                                   here.  One reason to do this would be to
                                   sacrifice DNA homology to get an alignment
                                   that has more biological significance.  The
                                   matrix constructed by this script optimizes
                                   for homology and ingores biological protein
                                   similarity to promote as many crossovers as
                                   possible in disparate sequences.  A codon
                                   usage table (-c) is still required in order
                                   to construct sequences with optimized
                                   homology while allowing homologous ties to
                                   defer to the more used codons.
     -e,                  OPTIONAL Aligned nucleotide sequence file.  The
     --evaluate-nt-aln-            sequence generated by other tools can be
     file,--nt-file                supplied for evaluation using the Crossover
                                   Metrics generated at the end of the script.
                                   Only one such file can be supplied, but it
                                   may contain any number of aligned sequences.
     --stretch-reporting- OPTIONAL [5,11] After nucleotide sequence
     min                           construction (see -o) or the submission of a
                                   nucleotide alignment (see -e), metrics are
                                   reported to gauge the effectiveness of the
                                   alignment and codon usage to produce
                                   sequences that are likely to be involved in
                                   crossover events.  Each possible pair of
                                   sequences will report the number of
                                   alignment positions involved in a contiguous
                                   stretch of identity that is equal to or
                                   larger than the number(s) supplied to this
                                   option.  For example, if this minimum value
                                   is 5 and a pair of sequences each has an
                                   aligned segment of ATTGCTA (and no other
                                   stretches of identity that are 5 or longer),
                                   the number reported for 'Contig Ident >= 5'
                                   will be 7.  The cutoff must be an unsigned
                                   integer.
     --usage-reporting-   OPTIONAL [0.1] After nucleotide sequence construction
     max                           (see -o) or the submission of a nucleotide
                                   alignment (see -e), metrics are reported to
                                   gauge the effectiveness of the alignment and
                                   codon usage to produce sequences that are
                                   likely to be involved in crossover events.
                                   Generally, codons more highly used are
                                   utilized, but lesser used codons can get
                                   used if another codon pair between aligned
                                   amino acids has more homology.  Each
                                   sequence will have reported the number of
                                   rare codons that were included for each pair
                                   of sequences.  You can set the max cutoff
                                   using this option.  Multiple space-delimited
                                   values can be supplied.  Any unsigned number
                                   is acceptable.
     -d,--segment-file,   OPTIONAL To align segments of each sequence (e.g.
     --domain-file                 structural/secondary domains or any regions
                                   that should be aligned together)
                                   independently and stitch the global
                                   alignment back together, you can provide a
                                   segment file containing pairs of coordinates
                                   that should be aligned sequentially within
                                   each sequence.

                                   A companion script (stretchAlign.pl) has
                                   been provided in this package that can
                                   generate a segment file that forces
                                   codonHomologizer to align the largest number
                                   of stretches of identity possible.  It
                                   generates a file for every pair of
                                   sequences.
     -n,                  OPTIONAL [0] If codon usage is not important to you,
     --ignore-codon-usage          you can ignore usage by supplying this
                                   option.  Any usage values in the codon usage
                                   file (see -c) will be ignored and the weight
                                   matrix used in the alignment step and the
                                   sequence construction will only be based on

## INPUT FORMAT: -i, --aa-file

The amino acid sequence file can be in fasta or fastq format.  There must be 2 or more sequences.  This is an unaligned sequence file.  Any alignment characters present such as gap characters ('-') or spaces will be removed.  It may be upper or lower case.  Codons for any ambiguous nucleotides will be generated as NNN.

## INPUT FORMAT: -c, --codon-file, --codon-usage-file                                                                                                                                                           

A tab- or space- delimited file of codon usage scores.  The first column is the single-character amino acid code, the second column is the codon (3 nucleotides), and the third column us the codon's usage score.  The score can be any integer or fraction.  The scores will be normalized, so the score column does not need to sum to any value.  Additional columns are optional and ignored.  Not all codons are required to be present.  All amino acids and the stop character ('*') are required to be present.  To exclude a codon from incorporation into all recoded sequences, you can either remove that row from the file or comment it out by inserting a '#' at the beginning of the line.  Empty lines are permissible.  Example:

    G	GGG	0.11	Gly
    G	GGA	0.21	Gly
    G	GGT	0.49	Gly
    G	GGC	0.19	Gly
    E	GAG	0.29	Glu
    E	GAA	0.71	Glu
    D	GAT	0.65	Asp
    D	GAC	0.35	Asp
    ...

## INPUT FORMAT: -w, --precomputed-weight-matrix     

The format of the weight matrix file is the same as is used by sequence alignment tools such as clustalw and muscle.  There is a row and column for every single-letter aminco acid code and each cell contains a score representing how good of a match the pair of amino acids is (i.e. how similar they are).  The last row and column (represented by '*') contains the minimum score.  Examples of these matrices can be found (at the time of this writing) here:

## INPUT FORMAT: -e, --evaluate-nt-aln-file, --nt-file    

The aligned nucleotide sequence file can be in fasta or fastq format.  There must be 2 or more aligned sequences of the same length and they must encode a protein (i.e. the first character must be in the first 5'->3' frame).  It may be upper or lower case.
   
## INPUT FORMAT: -d, --segment-file, --domain-file                                                                                                                                 

A segment file is a tab-delimited file consisting of a series of amino acid coordinates (starting from the first amino acid as coordinate 1) in each protein.  Each row of the file is for a different sequence in the input sequence file (see -i).  The first column is the sequence ID (which must match all the IDs in the sequence file from the first non-white-space character after the defline character to the next white-space character (or the end of the line)).  E.g. a defline of ">id1 my protein" would match a value in the first column of the segment file of "id1".  See the usage for option -d for details on how the coordinates are treated.

A segment file contains coordinate pairs for each protein that are aligned with one-another independently.  There must be the same number of coordinates on each row.  An even or odd number of coordinates are acceptable, but they are treated in pairs, meaning each odd and even columned coordinate is treated as an inclusive pair such that the AAs corresponding to the pair are aligned with that segment [inclusive].  In the event that there are an odd number of coordinate columns, the coordinate in the last column is paired with the last coordinate in the protein.

Gaps between pairs are also aligned in an exclusive coordinate fashion, but if one protein contains a gap and another has no gap between pairs, e.g. 1-10 and 5-15 (where no characters in the first sequence are aligned with the first 4 characters of the second sequence), gap characters are artificially inserted.  If the first coordinate (1) or last coordinate of a protein are not included, the first and last segments are aligned such that the end coordinate is inclusive and the inner coordinate is exclusive.

Example:

    Mj	24	119	160	256	352	482	487	711
    Pf	1	100	152	269	360	544	552	769

    Hs	38	176	230	371	419	514	516	817

Coordinates aligned:

    Mj	1-23	24-119	120-159	160-256	257-351	352-482	483-486	487-711	712-end
    Pf	*	1-100	101-151	152-269	270-359	360-544	545-551	552-769	770-end
    Sp	*	1-148	149-219	220-342	343-404	405-488	489-499	500-796	797-end
    Hs	1-37	38-176	177-229	230-371	372-418	419-514	515-515	516-817	818-end

* Sequence excluded from segment alignment and filled in with gap characters.

If a coordinate is larger than the protein provided, an error or warning will be printed.  If the second coordinate in the last pair is larger than the protein, it will be automatically adjusted to the last possible protein coordinate with a warning.  Any other coordinate out of range will generate a fatal error.

Coordinates on each row must be in sequential ascending order.
